To use the framework:

1. Open multiple shells in your IDE (Ensure you are in a virtual environment)
2. Download the dependencies in both ./frontend and ./backend with pip install -r requirements.txt (or whichever other preferred methods) and npm install (frontend)
3. Run the run.py file in the backend with one of your shells (py run.py)
4. Then do "npm run dev" to run the script for the frontend
